            <p><h2>Sao Miguel das Missoes</h2>
                Sao Miguel das Missoes was founded in the 18th century by the Jesuits or the ‘Society of Jesus’ and intended to convert the indigenous Guarani population to Christianity.

                Very little remains of Sao Miguel das Missoes, most of this historic site having been destroyed in 1768 as part of a campaign to expel the Jesuits. The church, of which some ruins remain, had actually already been ravaged by a fire in 1760.           </div>

            <p><h2>National Historical Museum</h2>
                The National Historical Museum of Brazil, or the Museu Histórico Nacional in Portuguese, is situated in the historic centre of Rio de Janeiro on the site of a Portuguese fortification, arsenal and prison. The buildings were opened to the public in 1922.

                Inside the museum, visitors will be able to see the throne of Dom Pedro III (1825-1891), the last monarch of imperial Brazil, and luxuriously ornamented imperial coaches. The museum also features expansive oil paintings of the Paraguayan War, which lasted from 1864 to 1870.           </div>

            <p><h2>Ingá Stone</h2>
                The Ingá Stone is a rock formation near the Ingá River in northeast Brazil which includes symbols and glyphs thought to have been produced by the pre-Columbian indigneous inhabitants of the region. The meaning of the carvings remain uncertain, but may allude to astronomy, animals and fruits.

                The first reports of rock art in the state of Paraíba were made by European settlers in the 16th century. The rock art at Ingá are the most representative group of a particular type of engraving tradition in Brazil. The stone retains symbolic significance for the descendants of the indigenous population of the region.           </div>

                Christ the Redeemer (Cristo Redentor) is a 30 metre high statue overlooking Rio de Janeiro. It is mounted upon an 8 metre pedestal and the 700 metre high mountain of Corcovado. It was constructed between 1922 and 1931 and is a Brazilian cultural icon and global symbol of Christianity.

                Christ the Redeemer was created by French sculptor Paul Landwoski and Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, working with French engineer Albert Caquot. It weighs 635 metric tons. The face of the Christ the Redeemer statue was created by Gheorghe Leonida, a Romanian sculptor living in Paris hired by Landowski.           </div>
