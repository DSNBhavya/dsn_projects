            <p><h2>Bhaktapur Durbar Square</h2>
                Located at a distance of just 15kms (or 10 miles) to the east of the capital city, Bhaktapur is an excellent option for a day or weekend trip from Kathmandu. A UNESCO world cultural heritage site, the Durbar Square (Royal Plaza) is the epicentre of this ancient Newari city.

                The square is indeed a living museum. You can see plenty of ancient monuments, buildings, and temples where ever you turn. If the weather cooperates, you can experience panoramic views of the Himalayan peaks from Nagarkot, a tiny hill-station village that lies near Bhaktapur. If you get the chance, try a home-stay to experience authentic Nepalese hospitality and you will get to enjoy the flavours of traditional home-cooked meals.</p>

                The Bodhnath or Boudhanath Stupa is one of the largest Tibetan Buddhists stupas outside of Tibet. It’s located at a distance of 7 km from Kathmandu and both locals and foreign pilgrims (especially from Tibet) visit this spiritual site. A UNESCO world cultural heritage site, this is one of the top places of Historical Importance in Nepal.

                Constructed by King Man Dev in the fifth century, this colossal stupa is built atop an octagonal structure, which symbolizes Buddha’s teachings. It is surrounded by several gompas or smaller temples.
                
                As soon as you enter the complex, the fragrance of incense embraces you and you can hear the prayer wheels creak, as the monks stroll around the base of the stupa. It is open throughout the day.</p>

            <p><h2>Lumbini</h2>
                Considered as the birthplace of Siddhartha, who later became Lord Buddha, Lumbini draws hundreds of Buddhist pilgrims daily. In the year 250 BC, the legendary emperor Ashoka erected a stone pillar here marking the birthplace of Buddha.

                Maya Devi, the mother of Buddha, gave birth to the Lord near a tree in the centre of the garden, which now houses a temple dedicated to her. Lumbini is around 300 km away from the capital city and makes for a great weekend getaway from Kathmandu. A UNESCO world cultural heritage site, Lumbini is more than just a religious place.</p>
