            <p><h2>Sydney Opera House</h2>
                The first image that comes to mind, when we hear Australia is the enormous and outstandingly distinctive form of architecture – the Sydney Opera House. It is a multi-venue for performing arts; the building shaped and changed the image of the whole country.

                Combining the elegance of ancient influence with that of modernists, Sydney Opera House remains one of the top historical places in Australia. The sculpture was designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon but was completed by an architectural team headed by Peter Hall.
                
                Today Sydney Opera House stands tall in pride as it has committed to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal with different community action plans for Accessibility, Environmental, and Reconciliation.</p>

            <p><h2>Mungo National Park</h2>
                Spread over 274 acres of land, situated 875 kilometers west of Sydney, Mungo National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The park is rich in the history of Aboriginals culture of Australia. The remains of oldest human in Australia, the Mungo Man, was discovered in this very park.

                It is also famous for the remains found of the Mungo Lady, the oldest person to be ritually cremated. Scientists have discovered artefacts that date back to over 50,000 years. It is a highly protected national park, with landscape unlike any other, resembling the surface of Mars, moulded by the climatic change since last ice age.
                
                Of all the Australia historical places, Mungo Park attracts thousands of visitors for its strikingly majestic sights.

            <p><h2>Ubirr</h2>
                Widely popular for its rock art and collection of thousand years old Aboriginal rock painting, the Ubirr rock formation at Kakadu National Park remains one of the top historical places in Australia. Unlike other historical sites, Ubirr, in reality, is a rock formation, consisting of a group of rock outcrops.

                The rock art galleries at Ubirr lie along the easy circular walking trail that stretches only up to 1 km. Witnessing tropical sunset over the woodlands, floodplains and dark ribbons of rainforest will give you an unforgettable memory for a lifetime. Most of the paintings at rock faces at Ubirr were created about 2000 years ago and have been painted and repainted ever since.</p>

            <p><h2>Fort Scratchley</h2>
                For the visitors who are looking to learn more about the history of Australia and its military installation, Fort Scratchley is the best way to start. The fort was built to defend the city of Newcastle against a Russian attack. The former defence installation has now been turned into a museum.

                However, the guns in the installation were never fired until 1942, when the shelling of Newcastle happened. The fort was closed for reconstruction in 2004, to attract more tourists. The fort has a special place in the military history of Australia. The museum was reopened in 2009.</p>
